# Apex Config

## Credits
[deaFPS](https://github.com/deaFPS/apex-configs-by-deafps) for the base config, check their repo out for more info.

## Launch Options

Right click Apex Legends in steam, click Properties and paste this into Launch Options:
- `+exec autoexec.cfg`

## Configs

To use these configs, paste autoexec.cfg, and optimise.cfg in:
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Apex Legends\cfg`
Make sure to edit the personal binds in [autoexec.cfg](autoexec.cfg) to suit what you like.

## videoconfig
videoconfig directory:
- `%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local`
rename the existing config to videoconfig.txt.bak and copy the new one in.

## Nvidia Settings
These are settings I use for some games on weaker hardware, if you know what you're doing feel free to modify them.
